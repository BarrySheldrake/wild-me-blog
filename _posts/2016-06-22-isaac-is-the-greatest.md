Hi, my name is Isaac Sheldrake. I am 9 years old and have a real love for the environment. I especially like to search out small bugs and love to watch birds. 

I live on a farm so I have a great asortment of wildlife right on my door step. So what's my plan


> To share with you all the amazing creatures that I see and tell you why they are incredible 

I also think it's important to let you know *how you can help* all these creatures. As some of them are not doing too well. 

I hope you enjoy my blog and if you'd like to get in touch please do.
